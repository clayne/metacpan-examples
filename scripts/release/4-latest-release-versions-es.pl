=head1 DESCRIPTION

This query uses an AND filter to get the latest release of Moose, MetaCPAN-API
and DBIx-Class.  Not that the "term" query is looking for an exact match on
"latest".  The "terms" query below it is looking for an exact match on *any* of
the release names in the list.  So, the "terms" query functions as an OR.  In
terms of SQL, you could write this logic using an "OR" or an "IN".

A release can have one of 3 valid status: latest, cpan or backpan.
